r"""
A module defining some "nicer" fourier transform functions.

We define only two functions -- an arbitrary-dimension forward transform, and its inverse. In each case, the transform
is designed to replicate the continuous transform. That is, the transform is volume-normalised and obeys correct
Fourier conventions.

The actual FFT backend is provided by ``pyFFTW`` if it is installed, which provides a significant speedup, and
multi-threading.

Conveniently, we allow for arbitrary Fourier convention, according to the scheme in
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierTransform.html. That is, we define the forward and inverse *n*-dimensional
transforms respectively as

.. math:: F(k) = \sqrt{\frac{|b|}{(2\pi)^{1-a}}}^n \int f(r) e^{-i b\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} d^n\mathbf{r}

and

.. math:: f(r) = \sqrt{\frac{|b|}{(2\pi)^{1+a}}}^n \int F(k) e^{+i b\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}} d^n \mathbf{k}.

In both transforms, the corresponding co-ordinates are returned so a completely consistent transform is simple to get.
This makes switching from standard frequency to angular frequency very simple.

We note that currently, only positive values for b are implemented (in fact, using negative b is consistent, but
one must be careful that the frequencies returned are descending, rather than ascending).

    Arbitrary-dimension nice Fourier Transform.

    This function wraps numpy's ``fftn`` and applies some nice properties. Notably, the returned fourier transform
    is equivalent to what would be expected from a continuous Fourier Transform (including normalisations etc.). In
    addition, arbitrary conventions are supported (see :mod:`powerbox.dft` for details).

    Default parameters have the same normalising conventions as ``numpy.fft.fftn``.

    The output object always has the zero in the centre, with monotonically increasing spectral arguments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array
        An array with arbitrary dimensions defining the field to be transformed. Should correspond exactly
        to the continuous function for which it is an analogue. A lower-dimensional transform can be specified by using
        the ``axes`` argument.

    L : float or array-like, optional
        The length of the box which defines ``X``. If a scalar, each transformed dimension in ``X`` is assumed to have
        the same length. If array-like, must be of the same length as the number of transformed dimensions. The default
        returns the un-normalised DFT (same as numpy).

    Lk : float or array-like, optional
        The length of the fourier-space box which defines the dual of ``X``. Only one of L/Lk needs to be provided. If
        provided, L takes precedence. If a scalar, each transformed dimension in ``X`` is assumed to have
        the same length. If array-like, must be of the same length as the number of transformed dimensions.

    a,b : float, optional
        These define the Fourier convention used. See :mod:`powerbox.dft` for details. The defaults return the standard DFT
        as defined in :mod:`numpy.fft`.

    left_edge : float or array-like, optional
        The co-ordinate at the left-edge for each dimension that is being transformed. By default, sets the left
        edge to -L/2, so that the input is centred before transforming (i.e. equivalent to ``fftshift(fft(fftshift(X)))``)

    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        The axes to take the transform over. The default is to use all axes for the transform.

    ret_cubegrid : bool, optional
        Whether to return the entire grid of frequency magnitudes.

    Returns
    -------
    ft : array
        The DFT of X, normalised to be consistent with the continuous transform.

    freq : list of arrays
        The frequencies in each dimension, consistent with the Fourier conventions specified.

    grid : array
        Only returned if ``ret_cubegrid`` is ``True``. An array with shape given by ``axes`` specifying the magnitude
        of the frequencies at each point of the fourier transform.

    Parameters
    ----------

        the ``axes`` argument. Note that if using a non-periodic function, the co-ordinates should be monotonically
        increasing.

    Lk : float or array-like, optional
        The length of the box which defines ``X``. If a scalar, each transformed dimension in ``X`` is assumed to have
        the same length. If array-like, must be of the same length as the number of transformed dimensions. The default
        returns the un-normalised DFT (the same as numpy).

    L : float or array-like, optional
        The length of the real-space box, defining the dual of ``X``. Only one of Lk/L needs to be passed. If L is
        passed, it is used. If a scalar, each transformed dimension in ``X`` is assumed to have
        the same length. If array-like, must be of the same length as the number of transformed dimensions. The default
        of ``Lk=1`` returns the un-normalised DFT.

    a,b : float, optional
        These define the Fourier convention used. See :mod:`powerbox.dft` for details. The defaults return the standard DFT
        as defined in :mod:`numpy.fft`.

    axes : sequence of ints, optional
        The axes to take the transform over. The default is to use all axes for the transform.

    left_edge : float or array-like, optional
        The co-ordinate at the left-edge (in k-space) for each dimension that is being transformed. By default, sets the
        left edge to -Lk/2, equivalent to the standard numpy ifft. This affects only the phases of the result.

    ret_cubegrid : bool, optional
        Whether to return the entire grid of real-space co-ordinate magnitudes.

    Returns
    -------
    ft : array
        The IDFT of X, normalised to be consistent with the continuous transform.

    freq : list of arrays
        The real-space co-ordinate grid in each dimension, consistent with the Fourier conventions specified.

    grid : array
        Only returned if ``ret_cubegrid`` is ``True``. An array with shape given by ``axes`` specifying the magnitude
        of the real-space co-ordinates at each point of the inverse fourier transform.
